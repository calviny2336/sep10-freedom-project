# Problems I encountered and Takeaways

When coding in the carousel component from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/carousel/) I used the caption version so I am able to explain the functions of the mordern cooking tools. I couldn't get the local image to show up as a carousel so I skipped it and come back later. 

Something I learn when doing this project is trying to make yourself not as stressfull when doing anywork. For example at least work for any significant time if the due date is not tomorrow. It will make yourself less stressful and worrying not being able to finish the work in time.
